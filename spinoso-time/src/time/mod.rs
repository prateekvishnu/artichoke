//! Implementations of Ruby [`Time`], a timezone-aware datetime.
//!
//! This module contains implementations of a timestamp storage struct and
//! associated datetime operations that view that timestamp through the lens of
//! a timezone offset. These timestamps can be used to implement the Ruby `Time`
//! core class.
//!
//! There are two independent backends which can be selected by specifying the
//! `chrono` or `tzrs` feature:
//!
//! - `chrono` is based on the [`chrono`] crate.
//! - `tzrs` is based on the [`tz-rs`] crate.
//!
//! Both backends store datetimes as a `i64` [Unix timestamp], subsecond
//! nanoseconds as a `u32`, and a timezone offset which can be one of several
//! types.
