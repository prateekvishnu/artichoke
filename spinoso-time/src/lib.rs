//! Time is an abstraction of dates and times.
//!
//! This module implements the [`Time`] class from Ruby Core.
//!
//! In Artichoke, Time is represented as a 64-bit signed integer of seconds
//! since January 1, 1970 UTC (the Unix Epoch) and an unsigned 32-bit integer of
//! subsecond nanoseconds. This allows representing roughly 584 billion years.
//!
//! You can use this class in your application by accessing it directly. As a
//! Core class, it is globally available:
//!
//! ```ruby
//! Time.now
//! ```
//!
//! This implementation of `Time` is dependent on the selected feature. The
//! **chrono** feature uses the [`chrono`] crate, and the **tzrs** feature uses
//! the [`tzdb`] crate for getting the local timezone information, and combines
//! with the [`tz-rs`] crate to generate the time.
//!
//! # Crate features
//!
//! This crate supports two backends which are independent of each other. The
//! availability of different backends is controlled by Cargo features, all of
//! which are enabled by default:
//!
//! - **chrono**: Enable a `Time` backend which is implemented with the
//!   [`chrono`] crate.
//! - **tzrs**: Enable a `Time` backend which is implemented by the [`tz-rs`] and
//!   [`tzdb`] crates.
//!
//! ## Additional features
//!
//! - **tzrs-local**: Enable the detection of the system timezone with the
//!   **tzrs** backend. This feature is enabled by default. Enabling this
//!   feature also activates the **tzrs** feature.
//!
//!   If the **tzrs-local** feature is disabled, the local timezone is defaulted
//!   to GMT (not UTC).
//!
//! This crate requires [`std`], the Rust Standard Library.
//!
