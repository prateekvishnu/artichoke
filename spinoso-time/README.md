Time is an abstraction of dates and times.

This module implements the [`Time`] class from Ruby Core.

In Artichoke, Time is represented as a 64-bit signed integer of seconds since
January 1, 1970 UTC (the Unix Epoch) and an unsigned 32-bit integer of subsecond
nanoseconds. This allows representing roughly 584 billion years.

You can use this class in your application by accessing it directly. As a Core
class, it is globally available:

```ruby
Time.now
```

This implementation of `Time` is dependent on the selected feature. The
**chrono** feature uses the [`chrono`] crate, and the **tzrs** feature uses the
[`tzdb`] crate for getting the local timezone information, and combines with the
[`tz-rs`] crate to generate the time.

_Spinoso_ refers to _Carciofo spinoso di Sardegna_, the thorny artichoke of
Sardinia. The data structures defined in the `spinoso` family of crates form the
backbone of Ruby Core in Artichoke.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
spinoso-time = { version = "0.4.0", features = ["chrono"] }
```

## Examples

Assuming feature `chrono` is selected:

```rust
use spinoso_time::chrono::Time;
// Get a local time set to the current time.
let now = Time::now();
// Convert the local time to UTC.
let utc = now.to_utc();
assert!(utc.is_utc());
// Extract the Unix timestamp.
let timestamp = utc.to_int();
```

## Crate features

This crate supports two backends which are independent of each other. The
availability of different backends is controlled by Cargo features, all of which
are enabled by default:

- **chrono**: Enable a `Time` backend which is implemented with the [`chrono`]
  crate.
- **tzrs**: Enable a `Time` backend which is implemented by the [`tz-rs`] and
  [`tzdb`] crates.

### Additional features

- **tzrs-local**: Enable the detection of the system timezone with the **tzrs**
  backend. This feature is enabled by default. Enabling this feature also
  activates the **tzrs** feature.

  If the **tzrs-local** feature is disabled, the local timezone is defaulted to
  GMT (not UTC).

This crate requires [`std`], the Rust Standard Library.
